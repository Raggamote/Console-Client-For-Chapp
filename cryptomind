Some thoughts about cryptography algorithms for chapp
 * connection to server will realized d-h algorithm,
 * After:
     * data will be encrypted by aes-256 bit
     * + simple hmac of encrypted data from server and client
     * hmac private & public keys on the d-h initiating,
     * it will help authorize the client for server, and server from client after session was created
 * In common case its not secured from mitM, attacker can use this scenario:
 * 1.hijacking requests from user and presents to him like a server
 * 2.when client would making some sort of whatsapp authorization by 2 connectors with some sort of smiles,
 * attacker can lie about smiles from second client, and making dialog open, so client will thinking that he speaks with
 * another human. Its can be bypassed if people will meeting and compare there secure codes.
 * Another case (also if people compare codes):
 * 1. intercepts 2 sides of connection (2 humans, which wants to communicate)
 * 2. they get identical secure code
 * 3. they are think that all is ok

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station-to-Station_protocol another case of safe alogrithm, but we cant be sure in certificates by clients...
 * so, only working case is to use checking of secure code in real life
